## Marcheweczki (little carrots)


### Old McGonagall had a farm, eo oh eo oh oh.
She wanted to have carrots ton, eo oh eo oh oh.
With a crunch crunch here
And a bite bite there...

I was kidding. It was **Anna Cichocka's, Kaja Dudek's and Julia Smerdel's** farm. But it was no rhyme.

### We are called Marcheweczki!

How many times have you struggled with reading an Excel file with data from the quiz? Have you wanted to export it to another format? 

**Ladies and gentlemen, we are pleased to present our brand new application!**

After importing a file, our little carrot workers will change it to desired format, let you read  and export it! Moreover, you are able to see the awards for each contestant, his place, nickname and time spent on quiz. And it's not magic, it's our programming skills :)
 

### How to run the program?
 tba :)
